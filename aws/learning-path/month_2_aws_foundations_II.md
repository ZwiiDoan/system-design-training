# Month 2 Plan ‚Äî AWS Foundations II: Event-Driven Compute & Gen-AI Touchpoint

## ‚úÖ Month 2 Goals
- Understand and deploy event-driven patterns (Lambda, EventBridge, Step Functions).
- Explore container orchestration choices: ECS Fargate vs. EKS.
- Build a semantic search PoC using Bedrock + OpenSearch Serverless.
- Produce architectural artifacts: sequence diagram, cloud comparison brief.

## üìÖ Week-by-Week Breakdown

### Week 1 ‚Äî Event-Driven Compute: Lambda, EventBridge & Step Functions
| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | Read about Lambda event sources, execution models, and limits. |
| Tue | Quiz: EventBridge vs SNS vs SQS (use cases, fan-out, ordering). |
| Wed | **Lab:** Wire up Lambda triggered via EventBridge from a mock "transaction submitted" event. |
| Thu | Add Step Functions to simulate a basic "risk scoring" workflow. |
| Fri | Commit a **sequence diagram** showing the event-driven flow. |
| Weekend | Write a short note comparing synchronous vs async orchestration strategies. |

### Week 2 ‚Äî Containers on AWS: ECS Fargate vs. EKS Deep Dive
| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | Read: ECS vs EKS trade-offs (cost, complexity, autoscaling). |
| Tue | Quiz: Which to choose when? Stateless apps, batch jobs, GPU use. |
| Wed | **Lab:** Deploy a simple containerized "portfolio simulator" API to ECS Fargate. |
| Thu | Try the same deployment using EKS (via `eksctl` or Terraform). |
| Fri | Commit a trade-off note or ADR draft: Fargate vs EKS for Robo-Advisor. |
| Weekend | Optional: Add CloudWatch monitoring & alarms to your deployment. |

---

### Week 3 ‚Äî Semantic Search Lab: Bedrock + OpenSearch
| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | Read: Bedrock Titan Embeddings V2 + OpenSearch vector search. |
| Tue | Quiz: Embeddings vs keywords, cosine similarity vs BM25. |
| Wed | **Lab:** Upload 20 financial definitions, embed with Bedrock, store in OpenSearch Serverless. |
| Thu | Add a Lambda function to perform a "semantic search" (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat is ETF?‚Äù). |
| Fri | Commit code + a **sequence diagram** for the end-to-end flow. |
| Weekend | Optional: Add a basic Web UI (React/S3) to query the system. |

---

### Week 4 ‚Äî Architect's Mindset: Cross-Cloud Thinking & Review
| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon | Read: Intro to GCP Vertex AI embeddings and vector search. |
| Tue | **Write:** 1-page comparison: ‚ÄúHow would this semantic search be built on GCP?‚Äù |
| Wed | Quiz review: revisit all major quiz concepts from Month 2. |
| Thu | Soft Skill: Read a summary of ‚ÄúMade to Stick‚Äù ‚Äî lessons in communicating technical ideas clearly. |
| Fri | Reflection: What was hardest this month? Where do ECS/EKS/Bedrock fit in a broader solution? |
| Weekend | Bonus: Write a public-facing README for the semantic search PoC. |

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Prerequisites Check (Before Month 2 Starts)
- ‚úÖ Terraform, AWS CLI, Bedrock access via IAM role confirmed.
- ‚úÖ OpenSearch Serverless access and Bedrock model access (Titan or Claude embeddings).
- üîÑ Let me know if you'd like:
  - A scaffolded lab repo for the Bedrock+OpenSearch PoC
  - Terraform templates for ECS/EKS lab deployments
  - Quiz templates for Lambda, Step Functions, Embeddings

## üîÅ Optional Week 5 (Buffer / Extension)
Use this week if any prior topics were delayed or if you want to:
- Extend the Bedrock PoC into a full financial Q&A feature
- Explore OpenSearch Dashboards for vector analytics
- Draft a multi-cloud architecture with hybrid AWS+GCP elements
