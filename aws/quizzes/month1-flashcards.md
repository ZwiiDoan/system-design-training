## S3 & CloudFront

**Question 1:** A financial advisory firm hosts a static website on Amazon S3 behind a CloudFront distribution. After updating a PDF brochure in the S3 bucket, some users still receive the outdated version. What could be the cause of this behavior?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- CloudFront has not fetched the updated object due to cache expiration settings.
- CloudFront is configured to ignore origin cache-control headers.
</details>

**Question 2:** A developer wants to ensure that CloudFront always checks with the origin before serving a cached version of a financial report hosted on S3. Which configuration will help achieve this?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Use the must-revalidate directive in the object's cache-control metadata.
</details>

**Question 3:** Your team is designing a secure document portal. Documents are stored in an S3 bucket and accessed only via CloudFront using signed URLs. Which steps should you take to prevent users from bypassing CloudFront and accessing S3 directly?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Enable Origin Access Control (OAC) and deny public access to the S3 bucket.
- Create a bucket policy that only allows access from CloudFront's OAC principal.
</details>

**Question 4:** You are optimizing a Robo-Advisor frontend hosted on S3 and delivered via CloudFront. Your goal is to reduce latency and S3 data transfer costs. Which actions will best achieve this goal?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Set a long max-age value on frequently accessed static assets.
- Configure CloudFront to compress content automatically.
</details>

**Question 5:** A team is deploying a static frontend using S3 and CloudFront. After deployment, users report seeing old versions of the application even after a new release. Which options can help ensure users receive the updated content without explicitly invalidating the cache?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Append a version query string to asset URLs during deployment.
- Configure a low max-age and no-cache on asset metadata.
</details>

**Question 6:** An architect is designing a secure static file delivery system. The files reside in S3 and are accessed globally via CloudFront. The architecture must support: - Granular access control - Logging of access - Blocking direct S3 access Which combination satisfies these requirements?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Enable CloudFront logging to an S3 bucket.
- Use OAC and deny all public access to the S3 bucket.
- Enable CloudTrail data events for the S3 bucket.
</details>

**Question 7:** An update to a client dashboard was made and uploaded to an S3 bucket. However, some end users still see stale content through CloudFront. What is the MOST efficient method to propagate the changes immediately?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Invalidate the specific file paths in the CloudFront distribution.
</details>

**Question 8:** You are tasked with optimizing content delivery for a global investment platform. The platform uses CloudFront backed by S3, and some assets (e.g., charts, PDFs) are updated infrequently but are accessed frequently worldwide. Which strategy provides the best balance of performance and cost-efficiency?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Set a high max-age TTL for those assets in CloudFront behaviors.
- Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost optimization.
</details>

**Question 9:** A junior engineer configures a CloudFront distribution for an S3-hosted web application. After deployment, analytics show a low cache hit ratio. Which actions should the Solutions Architect take to improve caching efficiency?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Ensure that cacheable assets (JS, CSS, images) use long TTLs and are versioned via file names.
- Review and minimize dynamic query string use in frontend requests.
</details>

**Question 10:** A financial news portal uses S3 to store HTML articles and CloudFront for global delivery. The editorial team frequently updates article content, but users still receive old versions even after refresh. The architecture must maintain performance while ensuring fresh content delivery. Which approach best meets these goals with minimal operational overhead?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
- Enable CloudFront cache invalidation after each article update.
- Configure shorter TTLs in CloudFront behaviors for HTML content only.
</details>


# Why It Matters

### Why do IAM Roles matter for building secure, cloud-native applications?
**Answer:** They provide temporary credentials for services and federated users, eliminating the need to manage long-lived keys. This is critical for FinTech, where preventing credential leakage is a top security priority.

---

### Why does VPC Peering matter in a multi-VPC architecture?
**Answer:** It enables private, secure communication between VPCs without traversing the public internet. For a Robo-Advisor, this means the application VPC can securely access a database in a separate data VPC, isolating critical data while maintaining low-latency access.

---

### Why does CloudFront Origin Access Control (OAC) matter for hosting a secure frontend?
**Answer:** OAC ensures that users can only access the S3 bucket content through the CloudFront distribution, not directly via the S3 URL. This prevents attackers from bypassing CloudFront's security features (like WAF) and directly accessing potentially sensitive static assets.

---

### Why do S3 Lifecycle Policies matter for cost optimization in a FinTech platform?
**Answer:** They automate the process of moving data to cheaper storage tiers (e.g., from S3 Standard to Glacier) as it becomes less frequently accessed. For a Robo-Advisor, this is essential for managing the cost of storing years of historical trade data and customer documents while meeting regulatory retention requirements.
