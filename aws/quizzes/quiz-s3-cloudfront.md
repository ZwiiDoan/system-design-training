### Question 1
A financial advisory firm hosts a static website on Amazon S3 behind a CloudFront distribution. After updating a PDF brochure in the S3 bucket, some users still receive the outdated version.
What could be the cause of this behavior?
(Select TWO.)

A. CloudFront has not fetched the updated object due to cache expiration settings.  
B. S3 bucket versioning is disabled.  
C. The S3 object's storage class was changed to Glacier Deep Archive.  
D. CloudFront is configured to ignore origin cache-control headers.  
E. S3 is serving from a different region than CloudFrontâ€™s origin region.

**Answer:** A, D

**Review:**
A: CloudFront caches objects based on TTL; if the cache hasn't expired, users may get the old version.
B: S3 versioning helps with object recovery but does not affect CloudFront cache refresh.
C: Glacier Deep Archive objects are not immediately accessible, but this would cause errors, not stale content.
D: If CloudFront ignores origin cache-control headers, it may not update the cache promptly after changes.
E: Region mismatch can cause latency, not outdated content.
**Correct Answers:** A, D

### Question 5
A team is deploying a static frontend using S3 and CloudFront. After deployment, users report seeing old versions of the application even after a new release.
Which options can help ensure users receive the updated content without explicitly invalidating the cache?
(Select TWO.)

A. Append a version query string to asset URLs during deployment.  
B. Enable static website hosting on the S3 bucket.  
C. Use signed cookies instead of signed URLs.  
D. Configure a low max-age and no-cache on asset metadata.  
E. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration.

**Answer:** A, D

**Review:**
A: Appending a version query string (or using versioned file names) ensures CloudFront treats each release as a new object, forcing cache refresh.
D: Low max-age and no-cache ensure CloudFront frequently checks for updates, reducing the chance of serving stale content.
B: Static website hosting does not affect cache refresh for CloudFront.
C: Signed cookies are for access control, not cache refresh.
E: Transfer Acceleration is for upload/download speed, not cache refresh.
**Correct Answers:** A, D

### Question 6
An architect is designing a secure static file delivery system. The files reside in S3 and are accessed globally via CloudFront. The architecture must support:
- Granular access control
- Logging of access
- Blocking direct S3 access
Which combination satisfies these requirements?
(Select THREE.)

A. Enable CloudFront logging to an S3 bucket.  
B. Attach a bucket policy allowing s3:GetObject to everyone.  
C. Use OAC and deny all public access to the S3 bucket.  
D. Enable CloudTrail data events for the S3 bucket.  
E. Use a CloudFront origin group with S3 as the failover.

**Answer:** A, C, D

---

### Question 7
An update to a client dashboard was made and uploaded to an S3 bucket. However, some end users still see stale content through CloudFront.
