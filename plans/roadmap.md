# ðŸŒ± 5-Year Roadmap to AI Solution Architect + Investment Platform (Python + TypeScript + Go)

## Stage 1: Foundation (0â€“6 months)

**Focus:** Learn ML/AI basics (Python) + start backend & frontend skeleton (TypeScript + Go) with **antiâ€‘churn architecture**.

* **Study days (3x per week):**
  * Delivered content on ML basics: supervised learning, regression, classification, neural networks (Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch).
  * Delivered content on Generative AI: prompting, LLMs, APIs.
  * React + Tailwind refresher (TypeScript) with hands-on exercises.

* **Build days (2x per week):**
  * **Frontend:** React + Vite, React Router, Tailwind, zod, MSW; data via **appâ€‘level hooks**; libraries isolated in **infra**; domain schemas in **domain**; state adapters in **core/state**.
  * **Backend:** Go microservices with clear **domain/services/transport** layers; typed contracts; consistent JSON shapes validated on the client via zod.
  * **Integration pattern:** MSW mirrors backend endpoints so UI can progress independently. Swap libraries (TanStack/Redux/Remix loaders) by changing the **infra adapter** only.

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone (Month 6):**
* Running web app (Go backend + TypeScript frontend) that can evolve with minimal refactors thanks to **antiâ€‘churn structure**.

## Stage 2: Data + AI Integration (6â€“18 months)

**Focus:** Multi-asset support + early AI-driven opportunity detection with **stable interfaces**.

* **Study days (3x per week):**
  * Delivered content on *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (selected chapters).
  * Delivered content for AWS ML Specialty prep (Python labs recreated here).
  * Delivered content on SageMaker for model deployment (Python).

* **Build days (2x per week):**
  * Add stock, ETF, gold data feeds; **app-level hooks** per domain (e.g., `useStocks`, `useEtfs`).
  * Opportunity Engine v1: non-ML signals (momentum, moving average, volatility) in Go, exposed via stable REST endpoints; adapters on the frontend.
  * Education tab: static content + quiz system; UI state exposed through `core/state` so components stay decoupled.

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone (Month 18):**
* Platform supports multiple assets; **interfaces stable**, implementations swappable.
* AWS ML Specialty certification earned.

---

## Stage 3: AI Solutioning (18â€“36 months)

**Focus:** Apply ML (Python) and integrate LLMs while keeping **ports/adapters** discipline.

* **Study days (3x per week):**
  * Delivered content for GCP ML Engineer certification path.
  * Delivered content on LangChain/LlamaIndex for RAG (Python).
  * Delivered content on MLOps with MLflow, Vertex AI Pipelines (Python).

* **Build days (2x per week):**
  * Opportunity Engine v2 with ML (Python models behind Go microservices). Client continues to consume only **appâ€‘level hooks**.
  * AI Tutor for education tab using LLM (TypeScript frontend integration) with adapters for provider swap (OpenAI/Bedrock/Vertex) at the **infra** layer.
  * Paper trading (Alpaca API) via a service adapter; UI unchanged.

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone (Year 3):**
* Friends/family can test platform.
* AI Tutor functional.
* GCP ML Engineer certification earned.

---

## Stage 4: Scaling + Leadership (3â€“5 years)

**Focus:** Enterprise-grade platform & public presence with **evolution-friendly architecture**.

* **Study days (3x per week):**
  * Advanced AI: Agents, multimodal, RL for finance (Python).
  * Enterprise architecture frameworks (TOGAF, Cloud Architect playbooks).
  * AI governance/ethics in finance.

* **Build days (2x per week):**
  * Scale to microservices + Kubernetes (Go). Contracts and adapters ensure teams can replace parts independently.
  * Personalized education paths with AI services integrated via stable HTTP/GRPC contracts.
  * Advanced Opportunity Engine (real-time ranking, alerts) with versioned APIs and strict backward compatibility.

ðŸŽ¯ **Milestone (Year 5):**
* Production-ready AI-enabled investment platform with **low migration cost** as tools evolve.
* Youâ€™re positioned as an AI Solution Architect and thought leader.
