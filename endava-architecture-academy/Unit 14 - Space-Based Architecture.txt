1. Where does Space-Based architecture get its name from?
    - The concept of tuple space: SBA is inspired by the technique of using multiple parallel processors communicating
        through shared memory, which is known as tuple space
2. What unique feature separates Space-Based architecture from other architecture styles?
    - It separates processing layer and persistence layer by using a message layer in between
    - processors rarely need to communicate directly with database. They read and write data directly against the shared cache (tuple space)
    - processors publish data to DB asynchronously using the message layer (queues or topics). Writers consume those messages
        and persist data into database.
    - in some edge cases, processors may need to read data from DB via the message layer with the help of Reader services.
3, Name three scenarios in which a processing unit would be required to read data from the database.
    - All processor instances go down so as the shared cache. When they come back-up, data will need to be read from DB to re-populate the shared cache..
    - All processor instances need to be redeployed with new version that is not compatible with the old cache structure.
    - There is not enough space in the shared cache to store all required data.
4. List 3 reasons why you would choose to use Space-Based architecture.
    - performance
    - scalability
    - elasticity
5. Why does testability rate so low for Space-Based architecture?
    - Because testing high volume is expensive and big test data is hard to be prepared. This means we normally have to observe the load in production
        instead of testing it in lower environment.
