1. Software Architecture is hard to define. What are some of the ways you can break software architecture down to help define it?
    - System structures and Processes
2. List the 4 dimensions of software architecture
    - Characteristics (Non-Functional Requirements),
    - Components,
    - Styles (Microservices, Event Driven, etc.),
    - Decisions (that bring the other 3 dimensions together)
3. Why is it not sufficient to say "our architecture is microservices"?
    - Because this only cover one of the architecture dimensions which is Architecture Style.
