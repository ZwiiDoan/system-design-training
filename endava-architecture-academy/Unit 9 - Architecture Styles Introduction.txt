1. Why is it critical to have the right architecture style in place for a system?
    - Because each architecture style carries different characteristics and limitations that decide how well it suits a system.
2. Describe a situation where you encountered one (or more) or the 8 fallacies of distributed computing and realised a "lesson learned" from it.
    - transport cost is zero: In many projects we had to reduce the amount of data transferred between services to reduce overall operation cost
3. What is fallacy #3 of distributed computing? Why is that particular fallacy so critical within the Microservices architecture style?
    - #3 bandwidth is infinite: network bandwidth is limited by service provider. Transferring too much data over the network will cause loss of data
        and performance degrades.
4. What two measurements are necessary for overcoming fallacy #2 of distributed computing?
    - Average response time
    - 95 - 99 percentile response time
    These will decide if a new distributed system can uphold SLA which decides its feasibility
