1. What are the two dimensions of the risk assessment matrix?
    - dimension 1: likelihood of risk occurring
    - dimension 2: overall impact of risk
    - total score = dimension 1 * dimension 2
2. Why is it necessary for risk storming to be a collaborative exercise?
    - so that everyone gets involved, contributes, and is aware of risks in the systems
    - reach consensus on risks in the systems
    - everyone has different expertises and insights in different areas of the systems so that they can identify different risks and impacts.
3. What risk rating (1 - 9) would you assign for unproven or unknown technology?
    - 6 or 9: likelihood of occurring is high (3) due to lack of expertise in the team as well as support and maturity of the technology,
        overall impact of risk can be medium (2) or high (3) depending on how much the technology is used in the system.
4. Why is it necessary that the risk identification phase of risk storming be an individual exercise?
    - different people can have different insights and focus on different risk areas
    - eliminate the influence of others on ones opinions so that no legit risk concern will be suppressed.
