1. Which characteristic is most important to focus on - performance or availability?
    - This depends on specific application, one can be more important than the other in different applications.
2. What is the difference between scalability and elasticity?
    - Scalability = System can gradually scale to handle increased load overtime with expected performance.
    - Elasticity = System can respond quickly to load spike and perform with an acceptable performance.
3. What is the difference between responsiveness and performance?
    - Responsiveness = How fast the system can give feedback for a user/consumer action, although it may be still processing it behind the scene.
    - Performance = How fast the system can fulfill/completely process a user/consumer action.
4. Why is it important to limit the number of driving characteristics for a system?
    - So that architect can focus on the most essential characteristics of a system and deliver a feasible architecture.
    Too many characteristics will make it impossible to come up with a successful architecture since none can satisty all the characteristics.
5. What steps would you take to arrive at the final list of driving characteristics?
    - Limit the number of characteristics to a small number such as 7
    - Ask stakeholders to pick out the top 3 - 5 characteristics
6. What is meant by the "cart before the horse" anti-pattern?
    - Making architectural decision before really understand the business requirements.
