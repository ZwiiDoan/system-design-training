1. Name three warning signs that mean your development team might be too big.
	- Process loss
	- Pluralistic ignorance (afraid of raising opinions as they think they are missing something obvious)
	- Diffusion of responsibility (miscommunications, unclear of responsibilities and roles, lost of direction to progress, etc.)

2. What are three basic types of architect personalities?
	- Control freak architect (apply too much controls over the team and suppress their ideas/engineering practices)
	- Effective architect (the balance type)
	- Amrchair architect (does not produce useful artefacts)

3. What are the five main factors that go into determining the level of control you should exhibit on a development team?
	- Team familiarity: the more familiar with each other the team, the less control required
	- Team size: the higher the team size, the more control required (highest weighted factor)
	- Overall experience: the more experienced the team, the less control required (second-highest weighted factor)
	- Project complexity: the more complexity the project, the more control required
	- Project duration: the longer the project, the more control required

4. If checklists are so effective, then why not make everything a development team does a checklist?
	- The longer and the more checklists that a team have, the less frequent they are used or executed accurately.
